--- ROGUELIKE SOULS FUTURE UPDATES ---

MAJOR CHANGES:
	- Add Paintings. At least one for each map, shouldn't take long. (And get Anor Londo one working the same way.)
	- Will have bonfires appear whenever a boss is defeated, so you can buy any remaining Motes in that level.
	- Shopkeepers currently refuse to sell to you in that level if hit, even if they don't become hostile. This is because I can't figure out how to remove their general "aggro" with ESD.
	- Magic will be improved.
	- Random allies. Try white soapstone sign system - but there might be issues getting them into the boss fight, then.
	- Enemy "squads". Certain enemies (like small humanoids, or bugs) have a chance of spawning the same enemy nearby, with the same patrol points, if any.
	- "Story mode". More on this later...

MINOR CHANGES:
	- Fix map load trigger in Undead Parish elevator (add to Firelink).
	- Record Cast Light head effects and inject into m12_01 EMEVD event for opening special light door.
	- Add a Nito sword event to every map, then add a call to the constructor (with Nito's ID as an argument) only if Nito is in that map (just check for bosses and Very Rare enemies).
	- Fix Pine Resin usage.
	- Check Dire weapon damage.
	- Add invisible wall near Logan.
	- What happens in Abyss battles if you've already defeated the real Abyss boss in New Londo Ruins?
	- Using a Homeward Bone in the Abyss after defeating the real boss there causes issues.
	- Add spells to merchants.
